NOTE:	The subFood method in Hive.java returns the total amount of foodCost not met. While nothing
		makes use of this yet, you could use it to decide how severe the bee mortality is
		in starvation mode.
NOTE:	Periodically throughout the code there are "Throw ... warning!" comments. These need to be
		picked up later when you get around to giving the player warnings.
NOTE:	Drones should be their own "department," as should clustered bees
NOTE:	Look into a way to hard code the default department for worker and drone Batches
NOTE:	The Queen's health should be perpetually declining, but declining slower based on how much her
		attendant bees are helping. Need to make it worth it to try and keep queen healthy
NOTE:	Figure out how Events, Situations, and States work (put them into a Circumstance Manager?)
		-An Event is triggered by a conditional and doesn't need to save any information
		-A Situation is triggered by a conditional, lasts for a set amount of time, and influences
		 the hive's variables. It might need to save how it changed the variable.
		-A State is triggered by a conditional, has no timer, and is "untriggered" by a conditional
