NOTE:	The Occurrences have a lot of flexibility. Make the most out of it with fun and
		unique buffs/debuffs, status effects, etc.
NOTE:	Newly-created bees are added to the cluster department
NOTE:   1 tick = 1/2 second


TO DO:
        -Refactor droneXP to NOT be a DepartmentJob
        -Look at upgrades hashmap. Consider replacing with a Record class
        -Refactor winter
        -Get upgrades figured out, get constants figured out
        -Figure out how to throw warnings to the player


CONSIDERATIONS:
	-Make the bad eventModifier/event/states more interesting than "some bees died"?
	-Reduce the complexity of occurrences to only a FEW bad things that are influenced by
	 the hive's variables (strength, hygiene, etc.)?
	-Change Hive's "cluster" department to "beard" department? (depending on how winter clustering works)
	-Maybe add a mechanic for maximum honey, etc. capacity that needs to be upgraded with wax?


Fragilities:
    -Value for winterFoodCost (in updateWinter() in Hive) is hardcoded into the source code
    -The equations in occurrences (and possibly elsewhere) can have a div0 error
    -Occurrence handling methods full of hard-coded values


LEFT OFF AT: Hive.java adjustBeesEverywhere() and BeeCreator.java adjustBeesEverywhere() are identical. Perhaps it's
             wise to consolidate it, along with the other "useful methods" in Hive.java, to a different location. This
             would solve the duplicate code problem without causing too much of a mess.
