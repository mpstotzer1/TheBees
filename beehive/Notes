NOTE:	The Occurrences have a staggering amount of flexibility. Make the most out of it with fun and
		unique buffs/debuffs, status effects, etc.
NOTE:	Newly-created bees are added to the cluster department
NOTE:   1 tick = 1/2 second


TO DO:
        -Refactor winter
        -Prune and test which upgrades are to keep (most of them unused right now)
        -Figure out how to throw warnings to the player


CONSIDERATIONS:
    -Create an "on track to survive the winter" flag for the player
	-Make the bad eventModifier/event/states more interesting than "some bees died"?
	-Reduce the complexity of occurrences to only a FEW bad things that are influenced by
	 the gameLogic's variables (strength, hygiene, etc.)?
	-Change Hive's "cluster" department to "beard" department? (depending on how winter clustering works)
	-Maybe add a mechanic for maximum honey, etc. capacity that needs to be upgraded with wax?


Fragilities:
    -The equations in occurrences (and possibly elsewhere) can have a div0 error
    -Occurrence handling methods full of hard-coded values


LEFT OFF AT: AHH! The service locator has turned! (I accidentally used it in the constructor for something (maybe Season)
                    but the SL hadn't been initialized at that point and I got a nullptr exception. To fix this, maybe
                    go full dependency injection and try to really isolate the various modules (entities, whatever) so
                    that they need less dependence on other modules)
