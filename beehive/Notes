NOTE:	The Occurrence sections are chock full of hard-coded values. Just be aware of that.
NOTE:	The Occurrences have a lot of flexibility. Make the most out of it with fun and
		unique buffs/debuffs, status effects, etc.
NOTE:	Newly-created bees are added to the houseBees department
NOTE:   Time is governed by "ticks" of a clock (1 tick = 1/2 second)


TO DO:
        -Refactor winter
        -Get upgrades figured out, get constants figured out
        -Figure out how to throw warnings to the player
		-Eventually figure out the proper decimal number for heatTempConst


CONSIDERATIONS:
	-Make the bad eventModifier/event/states more interesting than "some bees died"?
	-Reduce the complexity of occurrences to only a FEW bad things that are influenced by
	 the hive's variables (strength, hygiene, etc.)?
	-Hard code the default department for worker and drone Batches?
	-Change Hive's "cluster" department to "beard" department? (depending on how winter clustering works)
	-Maybe add a mechanic for maximum honey, etc. capacity that needs to be upgraded with wax?


Fragilities:
    -value for winterFoodCost (in updateWinter() in Hive) is hardcoded into the source code
